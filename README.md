# Logistic Regression Gender Recognition by Voice

### A Short Summary Of The Logistic Regression 
It uses many techniques to analyse and predict the outcome, but the emphasis is mainly on relationship between dependent variable and one or more independent variable.

- Binary logistic regression – It has only two possible outcomes. Example- yes or no
- Multinomial logistic regression – It has three or more nominal categories.Example- cat, dog, elephant.
- Ordinal logistic regression- It has three or more ordinal categories, ordinal meaning that the categories will be in a order.
 
Linear regression is used when the response variable is continuous in nature, but logistic regression is used when the response variable is categorical in nature.
Predicting a defaulter in a bank using the transaction details in the past is an example of logistic regression, while a continuous output like a stock market score is an example of linear regression. 

### A Short Summary For My Project

In my project, There is a dataset which contains different features about man and woman voice frequencies. So, I tried to make prediction but more importantly, I wanted to see the accuracy of the Logistic Regression prediction.In my Logistic Regression project, the accuracy of the prediction is 0.968034727703236 (almost %97).

#### In addition, I tried to see Confusion Matrix for much more comprehension.
